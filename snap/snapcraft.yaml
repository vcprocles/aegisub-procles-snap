summary: Advanced subtitle editor
description: |
 Originally created as tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime
 fansubs, a less painful experience, Aegisub has grown into a fully
 fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor.

 It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing,
 typesetting, editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful
 scripting environment called Automation (originally mostly intended for
 creating karaoke effects, Automation can now be used much else, including
 creating macros and various other convenient tools).

 This is an unofficial snap, which uses wangqr fork of Aegisub. For any bug reports: https://github.com/vcprocles/aegisub-procles-snap
